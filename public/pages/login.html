			<h1>Login Test Page</h1>
		<!--	<p>Hello! This page is used as a test for the login import!</p>
			<p>The loginbar is now included by inserting the following line in your file:</p>
			<p><code> &lt;div ng-include="'angular_partials/loginbar.html'"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></p>
			<p>Given that the <code>controllers/controller.js</code> script is included in your file,
			and it is placed within an <code>ng-app="crudApp"</code> </p>
			<h2><b>Old:</b></h2>
			<p>By reading the code for this page, you can see that at the top
			we import the <b>loginbar</b> partial by importing <b>>loginbar</b> through
			handlebars. The login partial requires a <b>logged</b> (boolean) variable to
			be rendered along with a <b>username</b> (string). These are use to
			distinguish between a logged user and not logged in user, and to fetch
			the username for the profile link, respectively.</p>
			<p>The login partial can be imported in any page in any part of the HTML,
			it contains only two side-by-side buttons at anytime. The associated
			modals are added to the bottom of the body via jQuery to ensure
			they show up properly.</p>
			<p>As a basic example, the code for rendering page containing the login
			import can be handled via:</p>
			<code>
			router.get('/login', function(req, res, next){
				if(req.session.user){
					res.render('login', {logged: true, username: req.session.user.username})
				}else{
					res.render('login')
				}
			})
			</code>
			<p>This, of course, assumes the user is stored via </p>
			<code>req.session.user</code>
			<p>However, this may not be the case in future builds.</p>
			<p>As it stands now, logging in with GitHub redirects straight to 
			<b>'/'</b> but this could surely be changed to redirect to the calling
			page in the future!</p>
			<p>Try logging in and registering now! If you encounter any errors,
			or think of possible improvements, be sure to create some new issues
			with the relevant labels in the GitHub repo!</p>
			<p>Also, as it stands now (<b>Nov 28th 2015</b>) the profile page is
			unimplemented, so clicking the button that says your username won't
			do anything, but in the future it should redirect to a profile page!</p>-->
